# WebGPT

While ChatGPT stands as one of the most advanced chatbots in existence, it operates without a direct link to internet. Recognizing this gap, GPT WEB was conceived. Welcome to GPT WEB, where the limitations of static knowledge meet the boundlessness of the internet.

## How It Works:
1. User Interaction: Users initiate a conversation or ask a question through our intuitive interface.
2. Initial Assessment: The system evaluates the query to determine if it requires real-time data from the BING Search API.
3. Search Integration: Should the system identify the need, a web search is triggered to fetch the latest information related to the user's query.
4. Informed Response Generation: Results from the search are melded with the initial question, allowing for a more informed response to be crafted.
5. User Feedback: A comprehensive and current answer is presented to the user.


With GPT WEB, we've created a bridge between vast static knowledge and dynamic real-time updates, ensuring users always receive the most pertinent information.
